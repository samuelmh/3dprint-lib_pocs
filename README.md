# 3D Printing libs & POCs

This is an OpenScad repository where I put all the libraries I design for my pieces along with some examples or proof of concepts.


## Libraries


### Installation

In my case (Linux) I just do (in the base directory of the repository).

```bash
ln -s `pwd`/smh_lib $HOME/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries
```

For other OSs, please read the [documentation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries#Library_Locations).


## Proofs of concept
* [Nut & bolt](pocs/nut_n_bolt)
* [Vertical-printed hinge with support](pocs/vertical_hinge)
* [Origami paper bird](pocs/paper_bird) (2020-JAN-25)
